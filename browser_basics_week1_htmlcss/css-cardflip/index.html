Bordered by the Colorado River in the southeast, it’s known as the site of more than 2,000 natural sandstone arches, such as the 					  massive, red-hued Delicate Arch in the east. Long, thin Landscape Arch stands in Devils Garden to the north. Other geological formations include Balanced Rock, towering over the desert landscape in the 					middle of the park.
